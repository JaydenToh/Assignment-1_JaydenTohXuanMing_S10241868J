For my website, I based my ideas on the fact that I used all the frequently book advertising website and see how their website functions. While doing research, I focus on what could be possibly done during the time period I had
and started planning out the amount of pages my website should have. I also research what type of contents should be focus in the website, and the fesability of what I am planning to do. With all the information I have gotten
through research, I started working on my wireframes.

The user audience for the website I am doing is targetting fellow book lovers, readers and also highly book collecters. The purpose of the user audience visiting this website is to look for the most popular, highest rated and new and
blooming stories. The user audience can look for information on the popular stories that consumers of such stories are highly focusing on in this world. It also allows users to favourite the books that they like and find entertaining
into a column list so that whenever they return to the website they can see the stories they have noted. The website is catered to all the readers that exist, it gives them a platform where they can search for their ideal story and
to possibly explore the new genre of stories.
